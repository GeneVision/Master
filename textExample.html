    <h4><dfn>Vincere Vel Mori</dfn> :To Conquer or Die</h4>
    <p>Aaron had been staring out over the balcony <br> 
        allowing each of
        his senses to individually appreciate the scene before him.
        On his mind, <br>
         nothing could weigh heavier then the <i>sands of time</i>
       <br> 
       steadly and forever dropping down <br> 
       while this view begs you to 
        question is this actual apart of the same reality, <br> 
        the fear and fact
        of our limited perception <br> 
        perceiving through only the funnle <br> 
        with no ability
        see how much is left and <br> 
        suffering from managing whats been used, <br> <cite>Life 
        Magazine</cite> couldn't prepare him for this.

        Remembering his lessons from reading applying the principles from 
        <abbr title="How to win friends and influence people">H.T.W.F.I.P</abbr>
        <q>Don't Critize, Condemn or Complain</q> so moving forward doing his best
        in this new phase of life, become the fortifide balcony that provides a position 
        for someone else to view their <strong>Glory</strong>.
